Oncologist – Topic: Breast Cancer
What is Breast Cancer?
Breast cancer is a malignant condition in which abnormal cells in the breast tissue grow uncontrollably and form a tumor. It most commonly develops in the milk ducts or lobules and can spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant organs if untreated.

Symptoms of Breast Cancer
Symptoms may vary depending on the stage and type of breast cancer. Early stages may be asymptomatic, highlighting the importance of screening.
Breast lump: A painless, hard lump with irregular edges is the most common sign.


Change in breast shape or size: One breast may appear larger or differently shaped.


Skin changes: Dimpling, redness, or thickening of the breast skin.


Nipple changes: Nipple inversion, discharge, or crusting.


Pain or discomfort: Persistent pain in the breast or armpit.



Types of Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is classified based on where it originates and its biological behavior.
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): Non-invasive cancer confined to milk ducts.


Invasive ductal carcinoma: Most common type, spreads beyond ducts into surrounding tissue.


Invasive lobular carcinoma: Begins in milk-producing lobules and spreads to nearby tissue.


HER2-positive breast cancer: Aggressive type with excess HER2 protein expression.


Triple-negative breast cancer: Lacks estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors.



Risk Factors for Breast Cancer
Breast cancer risk increases due to genetic, hormonal, and lifestyle factors.
Female gender: Women are at significantly higher risk than men.


Increasing age: Risk rises after 40 years of age.


Family history: BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations increase risk.


Hormonal exposure: Early menstruation or late menopause increases estrogen exposure.


Obesity: Excess body fat increases estrogen levels after menopause.


Alcohol consumption: Regular intake raises breast cancer risk.


Radiation exposure: Chest radiation at a young age increases risk.


Sedentary lifestyle: Lack of physical activity contributes to risk.



Diagnosis of Breast Cancer
Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation and imaging followed by tissue confirmation.
Clinical breast examination: Detects lumps or abnormalities.


Mammography: Primary screening and diagnostic imaging tool.


Breast ultrasound or MRI: Further evaluates suspicious areas.


Biopsy: Confirms cancer type and receptor status.



Staging of Breast Cancer
Staging determines the extent of cancer spread and guides treatment decisions.
Stage 0: Non-invasive cancer confined to ducts.


Stage I–II: Cancer limited to breast with or without nearby lymph node involvement.


Stage III: Locally advanced cancer involving multiple lymph nodes.


Stage IV: Metastatic cancer spread to distant organs such as bones or lungs.


TNM staging system: Assesses tumor size, node involvement, and metastasis.



Treatment of Breast Cancer
Treatment depends on cancer type, stage, receptor status, and patient health.
Surgery: Lumpectomy or mastectomy to remove cancer.


Radiation therapy: Destroys remaining cancer cells after surgery.


Chemotherapy: Kills rapidly dividing cancer cells.


Hormonal therapy: Blocks estrogen effects in hormone-positive cancers.


Targeted therapy: Specifically targets HER2 or other cancer pathways.


Immunotherapy: Used in selected aggressive cancers.



Prognosis of Breast Cancer
Prognosis depends on early detection, cancer type, and response to treatment.
Early-stage detection: High cure rates with timely treatment.


Tumor biology: Hormone-positive cancers have better outcomes.


Stage at diagnosis: Advanced stages have lower survival rates.


Treatment adherence: Improves long-term survival.


Overall survival: Continues to improve due to advances in oncology care.

Oncologist – Topic: Leukemia
What is Leukemia?
Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, where blood cells are produced. It causes abnormal white blood cells to grow uncontrollably, interfering with the production of healthy blood cells.

Symptoms of Leukemia
Symptoms may develop gradually or suddenly and often result from low levels of normal blood cells.
Persistent fatigue: Caused by anemia due to reduced red blood cells.


Frequent infections: Abnormal white cells weaken immune defense.


Easy bruising or bleeding: Low platelet count leads to nosebleeds or bleeding gums.


Fever and night sweats: Result from cancer-related inflammation.


Bone or joint pain: Due to bone marrow expansion.


Unexplained weight loss: Increased metabolic demand of cancer cells.



Types of Leukemia
Leukemia is classified based on the speed of progression and the type of white blood cell involved.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): Rapid-growing cancer common in children.


Acute myeloid leukemia (AML): Aggressive leukemia affecting myeloid cells.


Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): Slow-growing leukemia common in older adults.


Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): Characterized by a specific genetic abnormality (Philadelphia chromosome).



Risk Factors for Leukemia
Certain genetic, environmental, and medical factors increase leukemia risk.
Genetic disorders: Conditions like Down syndrome increase risk.


Radiation exposure: High-dose radiation damages bone marrow cells.


Chemical exposure: Benzene exposure is strongly linked to leukemia.

Bone marrow biopsy: Confirms leukemia and determines subtype.


Cytogenetic and molecular tests: Identify genetic mutations guiding treatment.


Imaging studies: Detect organ enlargement or disease spread.



Staging / Classification of Leukemia
Leukemia is classified rather than traditionally staged, based on cell type and spread.
Acute vs chronic: Determines disease aggressiveness.


Cell lineage: Lymphoid or myeloid origin.


Genetic markers: Influence prognosis and therapy choice.


Disease burden: Blood, bone marrow, and organ involvement.



Treatment of Leukemia
Treatment depends on leukemia type, age, genetic markers, and overall health.
Chemotherapy: Mainstay treatment to destroy cancer cells.


Targeted therapy: Attacks specific genetic abnormalities.


Immunotherapy: Enhances immune response against cancer cells.


Stem cell transplant: Replaces diseased bone marrow in selected cases.


Supportive care: Transfusions and infection control during treatment.



Prognosis of Leukemia
Prognosis varies widely depending on leukemia type and patient factors.
Acute leukemias: Require urgent treatment but may be curable.


Chronic leukemias: Often manageable long-term with medication.


Genetic profile: Strongly influences outcomes.


Early diagnosis: Improves survival rates.


Treatment advances: Have significantly improved long-term outcomes.



Conclusion
Leukemia is a serious but increasingly treatable cancer with modern oncology care. Early diagnosis, precise classification, and personalized treatment have greatly improved survival and quality of life for many patients.
