Orthopedist – Topic: Osteoarthritis
What is Osteoarthritis?
Osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative joint disease in which the cartilage covering the ends of bones gradually breaks down. This leads to pain, stiffness, reduced joint movement, and difficulty performing daily activities.

Symptoms of Osteoarthritis
Symptoms usually develop slowly and worsen over time, especially in joints that bear weight or are frequently used.
Joint pain: Pain increases during movement or weight-bearing activities and improves with rest.


Joint stiffness: Stiffness occurs after inactivity or in the morning and usually lasts less than 30 minutes.


Reduced flexibility: Joint movement becomes limited, affecting routine tasks such as walking or bending.


Joint swelling: Inflammation and fluid buildup cause visible swelling around the affected joint.


Grinding sensation (crepitus): A crackling or grating sound occurs due to bone surfaces rubbing together.


Joint deformity: Long-term cartilage loss may lead to visible joint shape changes.



Causes of Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis develops due to gradual cartilage deterioration and structural changes in the joint.
Cartilage degeneration: Breakdown of cartilage reduces shock absorption and increases friction between bones.


Aging: Natural aging weakens cartilage and reduces its ability to repair itself.


Previous joint injury: Fractures or ligament injuries accelerate joint wear and degeneration.


Joint overuse: Repetitive stress from work or sports causes early cartilage damage.


Abnormal joint alignment: Uneven weight distribution increases stress on specific joint areas.



Risk Factors for Osteoarthritis
Several personal and lifestyle factors increase the likelihood of developing osteoarthritis.
Advancing age: The risk increases as cartilage naturally wears down with age.


Obesity: Excess body weight puts additional pressure on weight-bearing joints like knees and hips.


Genetic factors: Family history influences cartilage quality and joint structure.


Female gender: Hormonal and anatomical differences increase risk in women.


Occupational strain: Jobs involving repetitive lifting or kneeling stress joints.


Muscle weakness: Weak muscles provide less support, increasing joint strain.



Diagnosis of Osteoarthritis
Diagnosis combines clinical assessment with imaging to confirm joint degeneration.
Medical history: Evaluation of pain duration, severity, and activity-related symptoms.


Physical examination: Assessment of joint tenderness, range of motion, and stability.


X-ray imaging: Reveals joint space narrowing, bone spurs, and cartilage loss.


MRI scans: Used when soft tissue damage or early disease needs evaluation.



Treatment of Osteoarthritis
Treatment aims to relieve pain, improve joint function, and slow disease progression.
Lifestyle modification: Weight reduction decreases stress on affected joints.


Physical therapy: Strengthening surrounding muscles improves joint support and mobility.


Medications: Pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs help control symptoms.


Joint injections: Steroid or hyaluronic acid injections reduce inflammation and improve movement.


Assistive devices: Braces or walking aids reduce joint load and improve stability.


Surgical treatment: Joint replacement is considered when conservative measures fail.



Prevention of Osteoarthritis
Preventive measures help reduce joint stress and delay disease onset.
Maintain healthy body weight: Reduces excessive pressure on joints.


Regular low-impact exercise: Activities like swimming improve joint strength without strain.


Avoid repetitive joint stress: Limiting overuse prevents cartilage damage.
